# Cars_Case_Study
- Trying to achieve maximum accuracy by applying various Regression models.

  - Importing modules and loading the dataset.
  - Handling the Nan values.
  - Cleaning the data with the help of outliers.
  - Performing label encoding on the categorical data.
  - Creating a new dataframe with the help of the cleaned data.
  - Performing EDA and Preprocessing.
  - Creating the regression models.
    - Spliting the data in train (x) and test (y) set.
    - Creating the models.
    - Training and testing the data.
  - Performing accuracy check.
  - Performing Hyperparameter tuning.
  - Performing cross validation.
 
# Conclusion -

- The costliest car price is 45400$.
 
- The ovearall average mean price is 13087.304124$.

- Accuracy of all the models increased after tuning the hyperparameter.

- Max accuracy was achieved by tuning the DT model.
